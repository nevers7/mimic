#FACS Analysis of flow_m1c2_yl

```{r 1. Install Necessary Packages and Libraries}
#Install Flowcore
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("flowCore")

#Install ggcyto
BiocManager::install("ggcyto")
#Turn on necessary librarires
library(flowCore)
library(ggcyto)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

source("00-paths.R")
```


```{r 2. Read and Format .fcs Data}
#The read.flowSet allows you to read many .fcs at once. The resultant flowSet object will store the data from all these .fcs files.

mimic10fs <- read.flowSet(path = "../data/6-2-22-revised")

sampleNames(mimic10fs)
length(mimic10fs)
colnames(mimic10fs)
summary(mimic10fs)

#To be able to add gates, the flowSet has to be transformed to a GatingSet object with the GatingSet function
gs <- GatingSet(mimic10fs)
```

```{r 3. Set Singlet Gate - CD45 (APC)}
#1.define the gate
gs <- GatingSet(mimic10fs)
gs_get_pop_paths(gs)

singlet <- c("FSC-A", "FSC-H")
g_single <- singletGate(mimic10fs[[4]], channels = singlet, wider_gate = TRUE)
gs_pop_add(gs, g_single, parent = "root", name = "singlets")

#2.check the gate in a plot (before adding it to the gating set)
#showing the gating path
gs_get_pop_paths(gs)

#3.if the gate seems right, add / apply it to the gating set
#4.recompute the gatingSet to have statistics available
